// Most of the definitions for building your module reside in a common, shared
// file 'build.common.gradle'. Being factored in this way makes it easier to
// integrate updates to the FTC into your code. If you really need to customize
// the build definitions, you can place those customizations in this file, but
// please think carefully as to whether such customizations are really necessary
// before doing so.


// Custom definitions may go here

// Include common definitions from above.
